## This python version of SINGLE now produces exactly the same results as
## the Fortran version of HYPO71 from seiscomp, if all parameters are the same.
## TRVDRV and SWMREG give identical results (within precision) as Fortran
## subroutines compiled with f2py and called from python
## CALC_EPICENTRAL_XY_OFFSET and SHIFT_LONLAT_BY_XY take geographic coordinates
## in degrees rather than in minutes as in the original version, but have been
## verified to produce essentially the same results
## Residuals, azimuths and takeoff angles calculated for the same fixed origin
## are the same as those reported in HYPO71 output file; total weights are also
## very similar, within precision.

		bool, whether or not to use S phase picks for the location
		Corresponds to KNST option in original program
		(default: True)
	:param fix_depth:
		bool, whether or not to fix hypocentral depth to :param:`ZTR`
		Corresponds to INST=1 option in original program
		(default: False)
	:param fix_origin:
		bool, whether or not to fix hypocentral location and origin time
		in :param:`origin`, and just compute travel-time residuals.
		Implies :param:`fix_depth`= True.
		Corresponds to INST=9 in original program
		(default: False)
	:param max_altitude:
		float, maximum altitude of earthquake in km
		(default: 2.)
	:param azimuthal_weighting:
		bool, whether or not azimuthal weighting should be applied
		Corresponds to KAZ option in original program
		(default: True)
	:param XNEAR:
		float, epicentral distance up to which distance weighting is 1
		(in km)
		(default: 50)
	:param XFAR:
		float, epicentral distance beyond which distance weighting is 0
		(in km)
		(default: 200)
	:param min_rms_jeffrey:
		float, cutoff value for RMS below which Jeffreys' weighting
		of residuals is not used. It should be set to a value
		approximately equal to the overall timing accuracy of
		P arrival times (in seconds)
		Corresponds to TEST[01] in original program
		(default: 0.1)
	:param max_horizontal_adjustment:
		float, if the latitude or longitude adjustment (DX or DY)

		(default: 100.)
	:param max_horizontal_adjustment_for_depth_adjustment:
		float, for each iteration step, if horizontal adjustment is
		larger than or equal to this value, this step is recalculated
		without focal_depth adjustment. This value should be set to
		a value approximately equal to station spacing in km.
		Corresponds to TEST[02] in original program

		(default: 0.5)
	:param f_crit:
		float, critical F-value for the stepwise multiple regression.
		Should be set according to the number and quality of P- and S-
		arrivals. A value between 0.5 and 2 is recommended.
		If set to zero, a simple multiple regression is performed
		regardless of whether the matrix is ill-conditioned. This is
		not desirable because the hypocenter solution may be meaningless.
		On the other hand, if it is set to 2 or greater, then Geiger's
		iteration may be terminated prematurely, before a good hypocenter
		is found.
		Corresponds to TEST[03] option in original program
		(default: 2.)
	:param f_crit_divisor:
		float, division factor for :param:`f_crit` if no significant
		variable is found in the stepwise multiple regression. In that
		case, f_crit is reduced to f_crit / f_crit_divisor, and the
		regression is repeated. If it is <= 1, then the regression is
		repeated to find one variable, and the adjustment is made only
		if it is greater than f_crit_divisor * standard error.
		If :param:`f_crit` is set to less than 2, then f_crit_divisor
		should be set to 1.
		Corresponds to TEST[06] option in original program
		(default: 4.)
	:param compute_auxilliary_rms:
		bool, whether or not to calculate auxiliary RMS values at
		ten points on a sphere centered at the hypocenter.
		This helps to determine if the solution is at the RMS minimum.
		Corresponds to KTEST option in original program
		(default: False)

		bool, whether or not to apply Al Lindh's modification
		(default: True)
	:param force_hypo71_times:
		bool, whether or not hypo71 limitations on arrival times
		(S without P not supported, resort to S-P interval if S and P
		don't have a common time base) should be applied
		(default: False)
	:param min_num_phases:
		int, minimum number of phases required to compute a location
		(4 in seiscomp version, 3 in ROB version)
		(default: 4)
	:param use_fortran_speedups:
		bool, whether or not to use Fortran speedups for routines
		TRVDRV and SWMREG, if available
		(default: True)
	:param station_elevation:
		str, how to handle station elevation/depth, one of:
		- 'absolute': use negative absolute elevation
